description: Launch Gemini 3 Pro for visual analysis, UI/UX work, research, or second opinions
---

Delegate this to the **gemini** agent to handle independently.

The gemini agent will:
- Analyze screenshots, mockups, and UI designs
- Provide visual feedback on layouts, typography, color
- Research design patterns and UX best practices
- Offer second opinions on implementation approaches

If the user mentions a screenshot or clipboard image, note that the agent should capture it with `pngpaste`.
