Delegate this to the **whatsapp** agent to handle independently.

The whatsapp agent will:
- Search messages by contact name, keywords, date range
- List recent chats and conversations
- Find and display images/media sent or received
- Filter by message type (text, image, video, document)

Requires the native macOS WhatsApp client with messages synced locally.
